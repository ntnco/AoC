# AoC
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

## Context
The first time I participated in AoC was in 2017, within 1 year of writing my first spaghetti. I reached [day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2017/) and got stuck on part 2 because I could do recursions. Fast forward to 2020, in my second year of CS at University of Montreal, and I'm looking forward to complete all puzzles on the day they come out!

## Approach
These solutions were completed blind: without looking at others' solutions.
